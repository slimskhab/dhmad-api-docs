title: API Keys Management
description: Learn how to manage your API keys effectively
---

API keys are the primary method of authenticating with the DHMAD API. This guide covers best practices for managing your keys.

## Creating API Keys

1. Log into the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.dhmad.tn/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Provide:
   - **Key Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Production App", "Staging Environment")
   - **App Name**: Optional application name
   - **Website**: Optional website URL
   - **Description**: Optional description of the key's purpose
5. Copy your key immediately - it won't be shown again!

<Warning>
  API keys are only displayed once when created. Make sure to copy and store them securely.
</Warning>

## Key Management

### Viewing Keys

In the dashboard, you can see:
- Key name and description
- Creation date
- Last used date
- Active/Inactive status

### Regenerating Keys

To regenerate a key:

1. Find the key in your dashboard
2. Click the regenerate icon
3. Confirm the action
4. Copy the new key immediately

<Warning>
  Regenerating a key immediately invalidates the old key. Update your application with the new key before regenerating.
</Warning>

### Deactivating Keys

To temporarily disable a key:

1. Find the key in your dashboard
2. Toggle the active status
3. The key will be disabled but not deleted

### Deleting Keys

To permanently delete a key:

1. Find the key in your dashboard
2. Click the delete icon
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a key is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you have a backup key before deleting.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

    Use sandbox keys (`sk_sandbox_`) for testing and live keys (`sk_live_`) for production. See [Sandbox](/docs/guides/sandbox).

  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit Access" icon="user-shield">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Environment Variables

Store API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
DHMAD_API_KEY=sk_live_abc123...
```

Access in your code:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const API_KEY = process.env.DHMAD_API_KEY;
```

```python Python
import os

API_KEY = os.getenv('DHMAD_API_KEY')
```

```bash Shell
export DHMAD_API_KEY=sk_live_abc123...
```
</CodeGroup>

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Keys stored in environment variables
- [ ] Keys not committed to version control
- [ ] `.env` files in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Different keys for each environment
- [ ] Keys rotated periodically
- [ ] Access limited to necessary team members
- [ ] Monitoring enabled for key usage

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error

- Verify the key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check the key is active in the dashboard
- Ensure you're using the correct key for your environment: `sk_live_` for production (`api.dhmad.tn`), `sk_sandbox_` for the [sandbox](/docs/guides/sandbox) (`sandbox.dhmad.tn`). Using the wrong key type returns a clear 401 message.

### Key Not Working

- Verify the key hasn't been regenerated
- Check the key hasn't been deleted
- Ensure your developer account is associated with a user account

<Note>
  If a key is compromised, regenerate it immediately and update all applications using it.
