description: Introduction to the Escrows API
---

The Escrows API allows you to create and manage secure escrow transactions between buyers and sellers.

## Overview

Escrows are secure transactions where funds are held until both parties agree that the transaction is complete. The API provides endpoints to:

- Create new escrow transactions
- List and filter your escrows
- Get detailed information about specific escrows
- Receive real-time notifications via webhooks

<Warning>
  Your developer account must be associated with a user account to create escrows. The associated user account must have email and phone verification completed.
</Warning>

## Escrow Statuses

Escrows progress through the following statuses:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="pending" icon="clock">
    Escrow created, waiting for payment. The buyer needs to accept and pay.
  </Card>
  <Card title="paid" icon="check">
    Payment received and locked in escrow. Waiting for seller to deliver.
  </Card>
  <Card title="delivered" icon="truck">
    Service/product delivered. Waiting for buyer to confirm completion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="completed" icon="circle-check">
    Transaction completed successfully. Funds released to seller.
  </Card>
  <Card title="cancelled" icon="x">
    Escrow was cancelled. Funds returned to buyer if payment was made.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Buyer Handling

When creating an escrow, you provide the buyer's email address. The system handles two scenarios:

### Existing User

If the buyer email corresponds to an existing user account:
- The escrow is linked to their account
- They receive an in-app notification
- They receive an email notification
- They can view and interact with the escrow immediately

### New User

If the buyer email doesn't correspond to an existing user:
- An invitation email is sent with a registration link
- The escrow is created with the email stored
- Once they register using the link, the escrow is automatically linked to their account
- The registration link includes a secure token for verification

## Contract Creation

When you create an escrow via the API, a contract is automatically created with the terms you provide. Both parties must sign the contract before the buyer can pay.
