title: Associating Accounts
description: Link your developer account to a user account
---

To use the DHMAD API, you must associate your developer account with a DHMAD user account. This allows the API to create escrows and manage transactions on behalf of the user.

## Why Associate Accounts?

The API requires a user account association because:

- Escrows are created for specific users
- Transactions are linked to user accounts
- Balance operations require a user account
- All API operations are performed on behalf of the associated user

## How to Associate

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard

1. Log into the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.dhmad.tn/dashboard)
2. Look for the "User Account Required" alert if no account is associated

### Step 2: Enter User Email

1. Click "Associate User Account"
2. Enter the email address of your DHMAD user account
3. Click "Send Verification Email"

<Info>
  The email must belong to an existing DHMAD user account. If you don't have one, create it at [dhmad.tn/register](https://dhmad.tn/register)
</Info>

### Step 3: Verify Email

1. Check the email inbox for the verification email
2. Click the verification link
3. The accounts will be automatically associated

<Warning>
  Verification links expire after 24 hours. If your link expires, request a new association from the dashboard.
</Warning>

## Verifying Association

Once associated, you'll see:

- A green "User Account Associated" card in the dashboard
- The user's email and username displayed
- Ability to use all API endpoints

## Removing Association

To remove an association:

1. Go to the dashboard
2. Click "Remove Association" on the association card
3. Confirm the removal

<Warning>
  Removing the association will prevent you from using the API until you associate a new account.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### "No user account found with this email"

- Verify the email address is correct
- Ensure the user account exists at dhmad.tn
- Check for typos in the email

### "Already associated with another developer"

- Each user account can only be associated with one developer account
- Contact support if you need to transfer an association

### "Verification link expired"

- Request a new association from the dashboard
- Check your email spam folder
- Ensure the link hasn't been used already
