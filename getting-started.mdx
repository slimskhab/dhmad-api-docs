---

This guide will walk you through setting up your developer account and making your first API call.

## Step 1: Create a Developer Account

1. Visit the [Developer Portal](https://developer.dhmad.tn/apply)
2. Fill out the application form with:
   - Company information
   - Contact details
   - Project description
   - Expected transaction volume
3. Submit your application

<Warning>
  Applications are reviewed by our team. You'll receive an email once your application is approved.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Set Up Your Account

Once approved, you'll receive an email with a setup link:

1. Click the setup link in your email
2. Create your developer account password
3. Choose a username
4. Complete your account setup

## Step 3: Associate User Account

To use the API, you need to associate your developer account with a user account:

1. Log into the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.dhmad.tn/dashboard)
2. Click "Associate User Account"
3. Enter the email address of your DHMAD user account
4. Check your email and click the verification link
5. Your accounts are now associated

<Warning>
  The user account must have email and phone verification completed before you can create escrows via the API.
</Warning>

<Info>
  The user account is used for creating escrows and managing transactions. Make sure you have a DHMAD user account before associating.
</Info>

## Step 4: Generate API Keys

1. Navigate to the [API Keys section](https://developer.dhmad.tn/dashboard) in your dashboard
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production App")
4. Copy your API key immediately - it won't be shown again!

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure! Never commit them to version control or share them publicly. Treat them like passwords.
</Warning>

## Step 5: Make Your First Request

Now you're ready to make your first API call. Let's get your account balance:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.dhmad.tn/api/v1/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Accordion title="Response Example">
```json
{
  "balance": {
    "available": 0,
    "pending": 0,
    "escrow": 0
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

## Step 6: Set Up Webhooks (Optional)

To receive real-time notifications when escrow status changes:

1. Create a webhook endpoint in your application
2. Add the webhook URL in the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.dhmad.tn/dashboard)
3. Verify webhook signatures for security

See the [Webhooks Guide](/docs/guides/webhooks) for complete setup instructions.
